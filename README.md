# Game: Highest number V0.1

I'm going to develop a very simple game to practice on
"if-else statement" and to use Python's "random" module

# aim of the game

play against the computer and try to guess if the number that comes out will be odd or even, 
whoever gets to 10 points out of a maximum of 16 rounds wins

# the game will be launched via terminal

with the command " python3 Giochino.py "
